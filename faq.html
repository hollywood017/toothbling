              <div class="answer">
                <p>A. Not at all. The procedure is similar to placing an orthodontic bracket (braces) on a tooth.
                  There is no drilling involved and the procedure is completely painless.</p>

                <p>A. Tooth Bling's Swarovski Crystals are small in diameter. Initially something on your tooth will

              </div>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>A. The longevity of a Tooth Bling Jewel on the tooth depends entirely on the individual client.
                  The natural acidity of your saliva and diet plays a big part on how long an application lasts.
                  The average time however, would be approximately 6 months to a couple years.

              </div>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>A. No! The jewel is bonded to the enamel like a orthodontic bracket without any drilling or pain.
                  The procedure and removal can be compared to the placement and removal of orthodontic brackets.
                  They can be removed or replaced anytime has no effect on the tooth enamel once the jewel is removed or replaced.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>A. No. The jewel can only be placed on natural, clean, healthy enamel. It can not bond to crowns, veneers or dentures.
                  We recommend placing it on top half of upper teeth or lower half of bottom teeth. Otherwise, it may come off due to natural chewing forces.</p>

              <div class="answer">
                <p>A. Yes, you can and should still have you teeth cleaned by a professional. Tooth Bling jewelry will not cause any problems for a hygienist to clean your teeth.
                  The area underneath the jewel is sealed like a filling and will not let in any bacteria. The hygenist can easily polish on top and around the jewel with a soft point.</p>
